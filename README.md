What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

    The problem addressed in this project was the organization and retrieval of course information in an educational setting, specifically focusing on managing courses and their prerequisites. This involved efficiently 
    storing, accessing, and manipulating course data to facilitate course planning for students and administrators.


How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

    Overcoming roadblocks, especially related to managing the prerequisites within the binary tree and ensuring data integrity when loading from a file, required a combination of rigorous testing, debugging, and research. I 
    implemented error handling to manage issues like incorrect data formats and missing information. Additionally, I refined the logic for dynamically linking courses to their prerequisites to ensure robustness and 
    reliability.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

    It took a mix of thorough testing, debugging, and study to overcome obstacles, particularly those pertaining to handling the prerequisites within the binary tree and guaranteeing data integrity while loading from a file. 
    To deal with problems like improper data formats and missing information, I put error handling in place. To guarantee stability and dependability, I also improved the logic for dynamically connecting courses to their 
    prerequisites.


How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

    My understanding of software design has expanded as a result of working on this project, especially with regard to the significance of choosing data structures and how architectural choices affect the scalability and 
    efficiency of programs. It has reaffirmed the idea that an organized program makes better software overall by performing better as well as being easier to maintain and adjust to changes.


How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    My programming practices have been greatly impacted by this project, with a greater emphasis now being placed on readability, adaptability, and maintainability. I've started developing code in a modular fashion, with a 
    clear purpose for each component, adhering to sensible naming standards, and properly documenting it. In addition, adaptability—foreseeing changes and making it simple to alter the program—has grown to be a crucial 
    factor in my development approach.
